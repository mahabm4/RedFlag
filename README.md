# RedFlag Safety Application

### **Main Issue**
Women's and children's safety is becoming increasingly crucial in Saudi Arabia and other countries.

The main issue with dealing with these cases is not knowing where the crime is taking place or whether it is taking place at all, 
it is difficult for the victim to contact anyone securely and discreetly to help overcome these obstacles. According to the World Health Organization,
90 % of all child abuse goes unreported, and one in every three women worldwide has been subjected to physical violence.

The proposed approach makes efficient use of them for personal security.

To assist in resolving these issues this project introduces RedFlag Application, a mobile safety application that allows them to securely send their location to
trusted friends and family in the event of an emergency. 

The goal of this project is to develop and implement a dependable system for preventing women and children from being harassed.
